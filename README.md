<!-- title of the project

introduction - one or two paragraphs on what the website is about, the intended users, what the website hopes to accomplish
*add photo of the completed website shown on various screen size displays*

possible add a contents table for the sections that will be discussed? 

you can use bullet points to descibe each section!!

features - describe the features/different parts of the project, what value each of the features provide refering back to the target audience, and how the website fits to the target audience with the features
e.g. nav bar, homepage image, foodie ethos, footer, other pages, etc - include screenshots of the features/sections
also include a features left to implement of any features youd like to add in the future 
- added custom font, but also added 3 differnt types of fallback fonts incase it doesnt load on certain screens or browswers (add screenshot of the code)
- added footer with links to facebook and instagram, also added a copyright logo as i have noticed this tends to be on majority of websites 
- used checkbox feature for the unordered lists as this seemed more interactive for a user rather than buller points, it makes it easier knowing what you need and still need to get/do
- used an class for the checkbox style as i didnt want all the inputs to follow that rule
- sections for each of the different recipe sections to split the page up more for the design
- images and videos use for the site are all mine, same as the recpie as its something i have been making myself for years
- features to add - search bar, types of cusine when they select there will be differnt types in tha tcategory, side bar to select, clickable images, log in, book marking


testing - go over the projects features and ensure they all work as intended, mention how they work on vaious displays, also mention any bugs, whether fixed or not, and how they were fixed, also include the results from the validator testing and teh lighthouse tool results from dev tools, include any unfixed bugs and why they were unfixed e.g. time contraints being a valid reason, not knowing is not valid reason, any short comings in the framework for example and why this wasnt achieved - add screenshots for the testing parts 

deployment - how the project was deployed and on what platform, can include screenshots and include a deployment link

credits - reference any sources you use, section them into the areas e.g. media (images, videos), content (text, icons, fonts, instructions)

- used font awsesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
- used google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
- recpie images used are all my own, i just used this image converter (https://image.online-convert.com/convert/jpeg-to-jpg) to convert images to jpg and this site to convert videos (https://www.movavi.com/support/how-to/how-to-convert-video-to-mp4.html) to mp4

- to check how to use checkbox feature for list items https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50649275/use-checkbox-for-list-style-type-in-unordered-list-in-html
- used this to help style the checkbox to align in the middle of the text but edited the code a bit so that it worked with my font https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306252/how-to-align-checkboxes-and-their-labels-consistently-cross-browsers
- my ordered lists werent showing with numbers so i used this to fix it https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2642067/ordered-list-ol-showing-up-un-numbered
- to add an emoji i used https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji_smileys.asp
- images side by side https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp i did edit the code to my liking 
- footer was sticking to top of page so i found a fix online - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/643879/css-to-make-html-page-footer-stay-at-bottom-of-the-page-with-a-minimum-height-b
i liked the idea of the nav bar at the top of the page and underlined so i used the idea from love running but changed the code a bit to match how i wanted it to look, i also liked the active feature but i changed it to suit how i wanted it to look
