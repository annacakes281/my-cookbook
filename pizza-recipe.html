                    Prepare all ingredients for the pizza dough <input type="checkbox" class="steps">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the flour, salt, olive oil and yeast into the bowl and mix together, and then start putting
                    the water and mixing, until the mixture is all incorpated and mixed together to a doughy consistency
                    <input type="checkbox" class="steps">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dust your work surface with some flour before putting the dough onto the work surface <input
                        type="checkbox" class="steps">
                </li>
                <li>
                    After placing the dough on the work surface, put some flour on your hands to prevent sticking, knead
                    the dough for about 3-5 minutes, until it has become smooth and no longer sticks to the work surface
                    or your hands, this process is to work the gluten strands within the dough - please note that you
                    may need to add some more flour to the work surface during this
                    process <input type="checkbox" class="steps">
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the dough has reached the above consistency, it is ready to proof/prove (proofing/proving is
                    where the dough
                    that contains yeast is left to rest and rise), to do this, sprinkle some flour back into your mixing
                    bowl and place the dough back into it. Cover the dough with some clingfilm, place a teatowel over it
                    and leave it somewhere warm for around 1 hour to 1.5 hours to proof/prove <input type="checkbox"
                        class="steps">

                            sauce</a>, make it now as it will need time to cool before using it on the pizza</strong>
