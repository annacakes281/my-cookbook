            <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Rest Time:</strong> 1-1.5 hours</p>

                <li>
                    Place the flour, salt, olive oil and yeast into the bowl and mix together, and then start putting
                    the water and mixing, until the mixture is all incorpated and mixed together to a doughy consistency
                    <input type="checkbox" class="checkbox">

                <li>
                    After placing the dough on the work surface, put some flour on your hands to prevent sticking, knead
                    the dough for about 3-5 minutes, until it has become smooth and no longer sticks to the work surface
                    or your hands, this process is to work the gluten strands within the dough - please note that you
                    may need to add some more flour to the work surface during this
                    process <input type="checkbox" class="checkbox">

                    Once the dough has reached the consistency where you can stetch it and it is smooth, it is ready to
                    proof/prove (proofing/proving is where the dough
                    that contains yeast is left to rest and rise), to do this, sprinkle some flour back into your mixing
                    bowl and place the dough back into it. Cover the dough with some clingfilm, place a teatowel over it
                    and leave it somewhere warm for around 1 hour to 1.5 hours to proof/prove <input type="checkbox"

                <li>
                    Once the pizza dough has rested for between 1 hour to 1.5 hours, bring it back to your work surface,
                    it will have doubled in size while resting in a warm place. Dust your work surface with some flour,
                    and place the dough down on it <input type="checkbox" class="checkbox">

                    At this point, you can deicde how to roll out your pizza, whether you want to have smaller ones,
                    like I did or have a larger one (like one of the images at the top of the page). Use the knife to
                    section into smaller bits of dough, then roll into a ball-like shape and start to roll it out,
                    remeber to roll in both directions and then also flipping it over to the other side to get a sort of
                    circular shape (although mine didnt't really end up like this, I was still happy with what I got as
                    it's still going to be pizza). You can make different shapes, that is your preference, once rolled
                    out, lightly sprinle some flour onto your baking paper and place the rolled out dough onto it
